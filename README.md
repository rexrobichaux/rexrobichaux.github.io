Welcome to my Github personal hosting site. Here, you can find fun side projects, personal musings, and other junk that someone out there might find interesting. 

Most of my dabblings are in the geospatial mapping, data science, and analytics areas. I like to use my personal interests (astronomy, fishing, cycling, photography, automotive, etc.) as opportunities to develop and apply my techical skillsets. Thus, you end up with a site like this...full of apparent technical randomness.
