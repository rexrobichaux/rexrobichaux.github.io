Welcome to my Github personal hosting site. Here, you can find fun side projects, personal musings, and other junk that someone out there might find interesting. 

Most of my dabblings are in the geospatial mapping, data science, and analytics areas. I like to use my personal interests (astronomy, fishing, cycling, photography, automotive, etc.) as opportunities to develop and apply my techical skillsets. Thus, you end up with a site like this...full of apparent technical randomness. 

# Virginia Trout Finder
https://rexrobichaux.github.io/VATroutFinder.html
The Virginia Trout Finder mapping application was my foray into Esri's ArcGIS Javascript 4.x API and is an attempt to make an easy-to-use, feature-rich and lightweight mapping application to allow users to easily find wild and stocked trout waters in Virginia. The application consumes data layers provided by Virginia DWR and Virginia DEQ in an easy to use interface. 

# Virginia Trout Finder Scene / 3D
https://rexrobichaux.github.io/VATroutFinderScene.html
Now in 3D! This new scene viewer allows users to interact with rivers, lakes and streams in a 3D, elevation-aware scene. Essentially the Virginia Trout Finder with Esri's WebScene / Scene capabilities included. To activate 3D mode, simply right-click & drag your mouse, or use the 3D navigation tools in the upper left of the screen.
